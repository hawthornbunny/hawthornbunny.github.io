                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>You will need a way to select random characters from My Little Pony, such as a deck of character cards. You can make the deck yourself, or use a pre-existing deck such as the My Little Pony Top Trumps game, or create a virtual deck on the <a href="decks.html">Decks</a> page.</p>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Shuffle the deck at the start of the game.</p>
                <p>Select one player to deal. That player deals 2 cards to the center of the table face up.</p>
                <p>Starting with the player after the dealer, each player in turn states a connection between the characters on the two cards.</p>
                <p>Once all players have stated a connection, each player then votes on which connection they thought was best. Players can't vote for themselves.</p>
                <p>If there is a tied vote, the dealer chooses the winner.</p>
                <p>The winner takes the two cards and scores 1 point. This ends the round.</p>
                <p>The next player becomes the dealer for the next round. Repeat until there are no more cards in the deck.</p>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>Connections can be as imaginative as you like - pick whatever you think will impress the other players!</p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>You will need a way to select random characters from My Little Pony, such as a deck of character cards. You can make the deck yourself, or use a pre-existing deck such as the My Little Pony Top Trumps game, or create a virtual deck on the <a href="decks.html">Decks</a> page.</p>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Divide the players into 2 teams of roughly equal size. Each team must have at least 2 players.</p>
                <p>One team is the <strong>Guessing Team</strong>, the other is the <strong>Listening Team</strong>. These roles will swap after each round.</p>
                <p>The Guessing Team picks one of their members to be the <strong>Clue-Giver</strong>.</p>
                <p>The Clue-Giver then secretly selects 2 random My Little Pony characters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>Stranger</strong>, who must be kept secret from everyone except the Clue-Giver</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Friend</strong>, who the Clue-Giver must show to their team, but not to the Listening Team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The rest of the Guessing Team must now try to guess who the Stranger is. They may freely discuss with their Clue-Giver, and the Clue-Giver may answer their questions and give clues (within the limits set by the rules). The Listening Team is allowed to listen to this conversation, so the Guessing Team is encouraged to use their knowledge of the Friend (which only they know) to hide information, by discussing the Stranger in terms of how it relates to the Friend.</p>
                <p>Once the Guessing Team thinks they know who the Stranger is, they announce that they are ready to guess. The Listening Team now has one opportunity to guess the Stranger based on what they've learned from listening in.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Listening Team correctly identifies the Stranger, they earn 2 points.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the Guessing Team correctly identifies the Stranger, they earn 1 point.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, no team scores any points.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Swap the roles of the Guessing Team and Listening Team to begin the next round.</p>

                <h4>Clue-giving Rules</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Clue-Giver must give at least 2 different clues to their team before they're allowed to guess.</li>
                    <li>Clues can't relate to the letters or sounds in the Friend's name.</li>
                    <li>Clues can't involve familial relations between the two characters.</li>
                    <li>Misinformation is not allowed - if anyone on the Guessing Team says something about the Friend that isn't true, it is the Clue-Giver's duty to correct the falsehood, even if doing so would give away information to the other team.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>This game works quite well online, when coordinated over a chat platform such as Discord. Voice chat is recommended in order to allow teams to confer more easily. Private messages can be used to share secret information with teammates.</p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>No physical preparation is required, as No More Unicorns is an entirely verbal game. Players need to be familiar with the characters of My Little Pony - the more obscure, the better. If necessary, players can agree to restrict the scope of the game beforehand (eg. Generation 4 only).</p>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Players take turns. On their turn, the player must name a character from My Little Pony, then say "No More [X]", where [X] is a category that includes the character they named. Example: <em>Rarity, no more unicorns.</em> Characters that would fall under this category are now excluded from the game and cannot be named.</p>
                <p>After naming a character, any other players may say "<strong>Challenge</strong>", and state why they believe the named character is invalidated by previous category rules. If players agree that the Challenge is correct, the challenged player is eliminated from the game.</p>
                <p>Players can't choose categories that would deliberately exclude every character.</p>
                <p>Players can't choose one-character categories (e.g. "Twilight Sparkle, no more characters named Twilight Sparkle"). If a player seems to have chosen such a category, they may be asked to "<strong>Name Another</strong>", in which case they have to name a second character that fits the category.</p>
                <p>The last remaining player is the winner.</p>
                    
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>Categories can relate to anything, not just species. Be as creative as you like!</p>
                <p>The exact definition of a category is often subject to interpretation, and this is an expected part of the game. Players are encouraged to discuss, argue, and seek clarification over the rules. If you can make a convincing enough argument, you may be able to evade a Challenge!</p>
