                <h2>A quick guide to Cockatrice</h2>
                <p>
                    Cockatrice is a free, open-source <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> client which allows you to build decks of
                    virtual cards and play against other people online. It also allows you to import custom, fan-made sets and
                    build decks from those. The following is a guide to help you import sets from PonyMTG into Cockatrice.
                </p>
                <h3>How to get Cockatrice</h3>
                <p>
                    Cockatrice can be downloaded from
                    <a href="https://cockatrice.github.io/" target="_blank" />https://cockatrice.github.io/</a>. It's
                    available for Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu derivatives. Installation instructions are provided on the
                    website.
                </p>
                <h3>Using Cockatrice</h3>
                <p>
                    This isn't intended to be a full guide to Cockatrice, but here's the basics: Cockatrice is two
                    things, a deck builder and a game client. When it starts up, you should see it in deck builder mode.
                    Here, you can search for Magic cards and add them to a virtual deck. When you're done building your
                    deck, save it by going to <strong>Deck Editor -&gt; Save deck as...</strong>.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To actually try out the deck you've made, you need to start a game. If you just want to test out the
                    deck by yourself, you can start a single-player local game by going to
                    <strong>Cockatrice -&gt; Start local game...</strong>, and selecting "1" for the number of players.
                    This will take you to the deck selection screen. Press the <strong>Load local deck</strong> button
                    and find the deck file that you saved. You will be shown a preview of what your deck looks like.
                    Finally, click <strong>Ready to start</strong>. This will open a virtual playmat and allow you to
                    try out your deck.
                </p>
                <h3>Adding fan-made custom card sets to Cockatrice</h3>
                <p>
                    By default, Cockatrice walks you through installing the entire <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> database
                    when you start it for the first time, so you most likely already have a full set of official cards
                    in there. Adding unofficial fan-made sets to this is fairly straightforward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, you need to have obtained a <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span> file for the set
                    of cards you wish to add to Cockatrice. That's what's in the text box at the top of this page. You
                    need to copy that data into a text editor and save it as a <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span>
                    file (you can call it whatever you like, as long as it ends in <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've saved the <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span> file, you can then import it
                    into Cockatrice by going to <strong>Card Database -&gt; Add custom sets/cards</strong>/
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the import succeeds, Cockatrice will ask you if you want to enable the set. Choose yes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should now be able to search for the cards you've imported, add them to decks, and play games
                    with them.
                </p>
