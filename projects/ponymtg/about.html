        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>PonyMTG</strong> is a card database for fan-made <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> sets based on
            <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. The aims of this project are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>to archive and preserve MTG card sets made by the Brony community;</li>
            <li>to make it easier for people to build and print their own pony decks;</li>
            <li>
                to provide virtual card data files for use with open source MTG clients (ie.
                <a href="https://cockatrice.github.io/" target="_blank" />Cockatrice</a>).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PonyMTG is a work in progress. As such, there may be bugs and rendering errors that haven't yet been
                fixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the cards don't have all their information in the database yet, just their images. This means
                that the search functionality is generally only good for searching by name. Exceptions to this are
                Sorden's IPU set (he provided a Cockatrice file), and any set created by FanOfMostEverything (his cards
                are already in full text format).
            </li>
        </ul>
