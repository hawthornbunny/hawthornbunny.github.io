        <p>
            If you've obtained a <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span> file containing card data, you can
            now import it into Cockatrice. It is assumed that you've already installed Cockatrice and run it at
            least once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open Cockatrice. From the menu, select <strong>Card Database &#x2192; Add custom sets/cards</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cockatrice will open a file dialog and ask you to select an XML file. Find the
            <span style="font-family:monospace">.xml</span> file that you saved, and select that. Cockatrice will
            attempt to add the card data to your local card database.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the import succeeds, Cockatrice will ask you if you want to enable the set. Choose Yes. You will
            probably need to restart Cockatrice to see any changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you restart Cockatrice, you should be able to search for and find the cards you've imported. You
            can now add them to decks, and play games with them.
        </p>

        <h2>A quick intro to Cockatrice</h2>
        <p>
            This isn't intended to be a full guide to Cockatrice, but here's the basics: Cockatrice is two
            things, a deck builder and a game client. When it starts up, you should see it in deck builder mode.
            Here, you can search for Magic cards and add them to a virtual deck. When you're done building your
            deck, save it by going to <strong>Deck Editor &#x2192; Save deck as...</strong>.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            To actually try out the deck you've made, you need to start a game. If you just want to test out the
            deck by yourself, you can start a single-player local game by going to
            <strong>Cockatrice &#x2192; Start local game...</strong>, and selecting "1" for the number of players.
            This will take you to the deck selection screen. Press the <strong>Load local deck</strong> button
            and find the deck file that you saved. You will be shown a preview of what your deck looks like.
            Finally, click <strong>Ready to start</strong>. This will open a virtual playmat and allow you to
            try out your deck.
